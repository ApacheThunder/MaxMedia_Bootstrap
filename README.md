# HBMenu Deluxe for Datal Games n" Music and Max Media Dock

This is a build of an enhanced version of HBMenu with DS Firwmare style graphics/sounds. This version is able to navigate two different devices via the shoulder buttons. Slot1 Games n' Music and Slot2 Max Media Dock can both be browsed simultaneously.

This version of HBMenu is also setup to autoboot bootme.nds from slot1 (if available) on Game n' Music. If used for replacement rom of Max Media Player carts (used for Max Media Dock slot2 devices) it will instead autoboot bootme.nds from that cart instead.

If neither slot1 or slot2 card is found it will automatically boot into GBA Mode. Otherwise you can trigger GBA mode by holding B on boot.

Holding any other button on boot will bring up the file browser.
